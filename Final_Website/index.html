<h2>Awareness</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    We are inspired to make a difference to our world because as it stands now most people aren't aware of the current situation of the world's waste.We hope to convey the sheer amount of waste in the world to make people more aware of the amount of trash that currently exsits. Mr Beast was one of the main inspirations and motivation for us as we hope to help communities around the world with our site.
