    <p>There are lots of people who are content with just learning one programming language but im here to show you that if you want to be easily accepted into any jobs then its best for you to be the jack of all trades and at least master the basics of every programming language
    </p>
    
    <p>Every language spoken is made up of adjectives, nouns, verbs and conjunctions. Programming languages are the same, they all encompass the most important basic elements which includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Programming Environment</li>
      <li>Data Types</li>
      <li>Variables</li>
      <li>Keywords</li>
      <li>Logical and Arithmetical Operators</li>
      <li>If else conditions</li>
      <li>Loops</li>
      <li>Numbers,Characters and Arrays</li>
      <li>Functions</li>
      <li>Input and Output Operations</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How to Know Which Programming Language Is Right For You?</h2>
    
    <p>Multiple Programming Languages can help you solve different programming problems that you might have in the future. Its best to find one programming language that you are familar with and work yourself up from there. Each language has their own unique way of organinzing their syntax and your proficency in these languages will help determine your skill when faced with a coding problem.</p>
