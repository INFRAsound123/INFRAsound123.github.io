       <h3><a href="https://www.g2a.com/">G2A</a></h3> 
       This website is a site where you can buy games,subscriptions,gaming accesories and all other kinds of gaming stuff for cheap.
       <ul>
           <li>
               C - This sites contrast is on point, it accuratly sets the images of the top 3 games to have a lower opacity thereby maxamizing the text on the image.
           </li>
           <li>
               R - There is a lot of repetition on this page as every game has some sort of sale, they all have the same color for discount. This really helps brings together the fact that G2A helps you find cheap games. 
           </li>
           <li>
               A - The alignment on this website is one point and everything is neatley organized with subtitles aimed to the left or right to sepreate the different kinds of games.
           </li>
           <li>
               P - This site also has amazing proximity. G2A has placed 3 diffrent games on their homepage and within one of those images that are tucked in close are 3 more games which are old and as a result have a bigger sale along with a buy cheaper button to emphasize the deals. 
           </li>
       </ul>

        <h3><a href="https://arngren.net/">ARNGREN</a></h3>
        This is a website where you can buy all sorts of vechicles,tools, and toys.
        <ul>
            <li>
                C - This sites contrast is hard to tell on some images as the opacity of some images is higher than the text.
            </li>
            <li>
                R - This site does have some repetition in terms of finding the price of their stuff, but some prices are bolded red while others aren't bolded.
            </li>
            <li>
                A - The alignment on this site is absolutley terrible, there is no line I can see or draw just a bunch of images placed together and wrapped in a border to indicate their relevance to each other.
            </li>
            <li>
                P - There is some proximity on this site but I can tell the owner didn't have enough space for some of them as some images are very big while others are so small I have to squint to see.
            </li>
        </ul>
